* Issues
** this assumes the human can notice a good solution?
** this assumes the human remembers what happened between starting the program and the scan:
*** was hit by a bus?
*** it takes a long time to take over the world?
*** competing versions of it being run?
** requires a solution to sub agent being alligned?
** AI_n are just AI_0 with more context?
** why would it very carefully take over the world? To minimize how much it effects it? So as to be as reversable as possible?

* Implementation issues
** compiler/language/etc bugs?

* Comments
** would be interesting to have a non random question...
