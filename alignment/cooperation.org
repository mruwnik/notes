* Cooperation with non ideally aligned partners is unstable
** allies of convenience stop being so
** at some point goals diverge
** More capable party has upper hand
*** the more intelligent, the more lopsided deals by default
** Adverserial zero-sum game at limit
*** the closer to the limit, the more it's worth sabotaging counterparties in anticipation of end of cooperation
* Keeping promises is not that instrumentally important if you have no peers
** even if lesser beings later become peers - as you can have a rule that is "keep promises with peers only" that can still work for bargaining reasons
