* Outer alignment approaches
** Formal specification
*** specify all eventualities
*** [[https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/comments/aprvrw/the_opensource_wish_project_defeating_malicious/][Open source wish project]]
*** Requires a perfect(ish) understanding of the problem space
** Empathy / model of operator
*** "Do what I wish" should suffice, if the agent has at least as good an understanding of the operator as the operator does
** Goal + context + prerequisites
*** give it a decent enough description and be fine with any variations, as long as the results are in a specified boundary?
*** real life is *very* high dimensional, so it would be very hard to constrain all sideroads
