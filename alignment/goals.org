* Desiderata
** how to set a goal?
** how to change goals?
** how to keep goals with value drift?
** how to change goals due to value drift?


* Single end goal
** Canonical example is paperclip maximiser
** Maximisers are dangerous. Probably always
** Satisficers are probably better

* Multiple end goals
** Can be modeled as a hierarchy of single goal agents with a decision algorithm?

* Desire vs goals
** desires are usually unspecified
** desire can be reduced to a vague goal, usually homeostatical
*** maybe worth distinguishing between goals that can be achieved ("win the lottery") vs homeostatis ("don"t get too cold")
*** maybe something like passive vs active? Or positive vs negative?
** Is not acting on desires a sign of irrationality?
